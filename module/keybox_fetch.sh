# Downloads a base64-encoded keybox from the project's keybox mirror
# ($BASE_URL/key), hashes the downloaded bytes locally to detect whether
# anything changed since the last apply, decodes, validates that the payload
# looks like a keybox, then atomically replaces the target file. Override the
# source endpoint with the KEYBOX_BASE_URL env var.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  keybox updated (new content written)
#   2  no change (already up to date)
#   1  fetch / verify failed (existing keybox preserved)

# rustls fetcher (asfetch) fails to connect on others. So we try each available

# first that actually returns bytes — never trust one tool to always work.
